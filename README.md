# SAT-Benchmark-Group-Report
By Micheal Chen , Mingyang su and Peng Zhang

The SAT benchmarks are designed to measure the college readiness of high school students, using the SAT, a college entrance examination taken by nearly 1.45 million students in all 50 United States and the District of Columbia. The SAT benchmark determined in this study was 1550 for the composite. Individual benchmark scores were also calculated for the critical reading, mathematics, and writing sections to provide indicators of student proficiency in each of these subjects, resulting in a benchmark score of 500 on each section. In the 2010 cohort of college-bound students, 43 percent met the SAT college readiness benchmark. This report provided evidence to validate the use of the benchmark for assessing college readiness by showing the association of the benchmarks with other measures of student performance in high school and college. Specifically, students meeting the benchmark of 1550 on the SAT:

• are more likely to enroll in college and are more likely to enroll in a four-year as opposed to a two-year college;
• are more likely to be retained for their second and third year of college; 
• earn a higher FYGPA, on average, compared to those not meeting the benchmark; and 
• are more likely to have earned higher grades in high school, are more likely to have taken a core curriculum, and are more likely to have taken rigorous courses in high school.
